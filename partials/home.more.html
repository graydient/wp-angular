	<p>Been playing with Angular and decided to hook it up with the WordPress REST API plugin. Some of the features include:

	<ul>
	<li> Pulls in and paginates the posts </li>
	<li> Query certain pages based on URL slug </li>
	<li> Auto-complete search that pulls in the post titles </li>
	</ul>
	</p>
